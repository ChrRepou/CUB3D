1. Remove extra colon:

	tmarts@2-G-4 CUB3D % ./cub3d maps/map1.cub
	Error! This is not a valid map!
	:%        

2. No error message with fully empty file

3. If possible - remove extra space (test case with empty map, one newline)

	tmarts@2-G-4 CUB3D % ./sanitize maps/temp.cub
	Error!
	There is not map to parse

4. When map is valid, but there are two newlines in the end (so not valid). Can you remove the extra spaces

	tmarts@2-G-4 CUB3D % ./sanitize maps/temp.cub


	Error!
	The map is not valid!

5.Map had a space on the empty line before the floor color. Can you remove the printed out empty lines and the floor color line?
	
	tmarts@2-G-4 CUB3D %  ./sanitizeb maps/temp.cub
 

	F 220,100,0

	Error! This is not a valid map!
	:%
